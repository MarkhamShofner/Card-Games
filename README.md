*began to realize the Bronze level functions, and place more functions in the Trello queue is as went
```

Unsolved problems, etc.
```
*Make the page more scalable in terms of CSS / HTML. More aesthetically friendly in different height / width dimensions. Need to clean up the position and location sets.
*Make the tie/war alert mechanism less intrusive. Tethering it to my specific page with a function, and not grandfathering in a somewhat ugly/random box.
*Clean up endgame functions. Right now the game just stops playing once a certain player loses all their arrows.
*Put in some more user interactability. Whether through new decision making (War is a boring and simple game), or through hover events on the players or something like that, I'd like to make the game do more when interacted with.
